In this program, we first prompt the user to enter a positive integer using std::cout and std::cin. Then, we use a for loop to iterate from 0 up to the input number, incrementing by 2 each time to ensure that we only print even numbers. Finally, we print each even number using std::cout and std::endl.

Note that we assume that the user enters a positive integer. If the user enters a negative integer or a non-integer value, the program may behave unexpectedly. You may want to add additional input validation to handle these cases.
